The files and folders here are "sandbox" applications testing
various possible ways of using qt and jxon together.
The most mature of these is jxongldock/jxdock.
It uses the jxon libraries to parse a json input
file of graphics primitives and displays it in qt/opengl window.
The README file there gives further compile and run instructions.

The jxon graphics primitives are not a complete set.  Their
structure is also open to change.  Their definition is not documented.
The code in jxprimitives.cpp and the samples in drugs.json are the only
"definition" of their structure.  The script sdf2json.py helps, too.
Currently, the following graphics primitives can be drawn.
cw means clockwise and cc counter-clockwise.
 cylinder
 sphere
 colorsphere
 triangle
 cctriangle
 cwtriangle
 trianglenormal
 cctrianglenormal
 cwtrianglenormal

The python app sdf2json.py reads an sdf molecule file and creates
a json file containing the graphics primitives to draw a colored
ball and stick model of the (first) molecule.

The typical use
  python sdf2json.py < drugs.sdf | jxongldock/jxdock

The others folders and apps use an older way of parsing json
and may not be of much interest.
