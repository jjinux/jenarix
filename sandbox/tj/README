The files and folders here are "sandbox" applications testing
various possible ways of using qt and jxon together.
The most mature of these is jxongldock/jxdock.
It uses the jxon libraries to parse a json input
file of graphics primitives and displays it in qt/opengl window.
The README file there gives further compile and run instructions.

The python app sdf2json.py reads an sdf molecule file and creates
a json file containing the graphics primitives to draw a colored
ball and stick model of the (first) molecule.

The typical use
  python sdf2json.py < drugs.sdf | jxongldock/jxdock

The others folders and apps use an older way of parsing json
and may not be of much interest.
