# the ugly, low-level way of setting entity attributes is to simply
# treat them as raw list containers:

(entity MyClass);

# create an instance

(set inst1 [MyClass null {}])

inst1;

# set an attribute

(set (inst1 2 symbol1) "value1");

inst1;

# the elegant way is to simply try the entity list as a hash

(set (inst1 symbol2) "value2")

inst1;

(set inst1.symbol3 "value3")

inst1;
