The ./build.sh script builds the lemon parser and the re2c scanner
which Jenarix currently relies upon for automatic code generation.

Relative to ../src/libjx, Jenarix expects re2c and lemon to be in:

     ../../ext/bin

The ./distclean.sh script cleans up the installed ext executables.

Note that there are some worthwhile lemon example files in src/tgz.
