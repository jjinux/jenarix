# how do we set and manipulate entity attributes?

(entity MyClass)

# since entity instances are merely lists, one ugly low-level way of
# maniuplating attributes is by mucking with the table itself

(set inst [MyClass null {}])

inst;

# set an attribute

(set (inst 2 symbol1) "value1");

inst;

inst.symbol1;

(get (inst 2 symbol1));

# however, "set" is entity-aware, so it is possible instead to simply
# use dot notation for setting attributes

(set inst.symbol2 "value2")

inst;

inst.symbol2;

(get inst.symbol2);
