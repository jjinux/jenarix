This folder contains source files and sample input files for an
app that demonstrates how jxon can be used to define a gui
application containing:
 horizontal and vertical splitters
 menubars and menu items
 opengl widgets
 generic container widgets

The Makefile should function to build the app by simply typing make.
It does not require qt's qmake program, although it does require
qt libraries.
If this folder is moved from it's location in the jenarix/trunk subversion
repository, you may need to change to location of the libjx and
header files in Makefile.

Usage:
  ./gui -qt   <gui02.jx
  ./gui -html <gui02.jx >x.html
The -html option outputs an html file that can be displayed in a
browser.  It reflects the structure of the gui as specified in the
input .jx file, but does not function at all and does not
implement any callbacks.
The -qt option causes a qt MainWindow object (application) to open
reflecting the gui as specified in the input .jx file.
It functions by displaying a dummy object that can be rotated in the gl window.
The callbacks in the input gui file operate fully, as specified by the
callback jx function in the input file.  The following new jx functions are
avaible for use withing the .jx input file, for use in callbacks.
 (qtAlert msg) opens a qt MessageBox containg the string msg
 (qtExit) cleans up jxon and qt objects and exits the app
 (qtFile) opens a qt FileDialog and returns the string filename selected
 (qtJxon) writes file guiout.jx containing a jxon representation of the gui
