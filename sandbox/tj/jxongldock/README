Sample app using qt4 to create a main window containing
a menubar, opengl widget, command i/o widget and webkit widget.
The app reads and display json jenarix graphics primitive on stdin on startup.
For example: python ../sdf2json.py <../drugs.sdf  | ./jxdock
or           ./jxdock < ../drug.json
The webkit widget is a custom widget containing a text line
input for a url and a webview widget to display the web page.
The widgets are arranged using two "slider" frames to allow
the widgets to be easily resized within the main window.

To make this app, you need to have installed qt4.
Type 'qmake' to process the jxdock.pro file containing the
info about which .h and .cpp files pertain to this project.
This makes a Makefile.  Then type 'make' to create the jxdock executable
(and assorted other moc_* and *.o files).

The menubar functions to:
 File/Open: opens a text file and displays it in the command widget.
 File/OpenURL: opens a URL and displays it in the webkit widget.
    a new url can also be viewed by typing into the webwidget url line.
 File/Save: saves the contents of the command widget
 File/Exit: exits
 Help/About: display blurb about this app in a popup window.
 Help/About WebKit: opens the webkit webpage in the webkit widget.

The command widget accepts input strings and echoes the command and
a dummy output string to the command output widget.

Files:
README:         this file.
jxdock.pro:     file processed by qmake describing the name of
                the project (exe file) and required files (.h and .cpp).
main.cpp:       simple main program, totally standard qt4.
mainwindow.cpp: creates the mainWindow widget containing
                the menuBar (a standard part of a mainWindow widget)
                and creates a GLWeb widget, a composite widget
                defined in jxdock.cpp
jxdock.cpp:     defines and creates a custom widget named GLWeb containing
                a gl widget, command (PlainText) widget and a WebKit widget
                layed out using two "splitter" frames.
glwidget.cpp:   a custom widget based onthe QGLWidget and containing methods
                to draw and rotate a simple test object.  It accepts
                json jenarix graphics primitives on standard in at startup.
jxprimitives.cpp: read and process json graphics primitives.
drug.json:      sample input file
*.h:            assorted header files associated with .cpp files
moc_*.cpp:      created my qmake/make; totally standard/invisible qt4 stuff. 
../jsoncpp/src/*.o:    json reader and writer
Makefile:       created by qmake processing the jxdock.pro file
