# pyjx is a Python-based Jenarix implementation intended to serve
# several important purposes:

# (1) to serve as a cross check for our main CJenarix implementation

# (2) to prove that the Jenarix platform is language-independent
#     abstraction capable of being hosted within many runtime
#     environments.

# AND

# (3) to serve as a roadmap for implementing Jenarix on a platform
#     which high-level containers and automatic garbge collection,
#     such as: Java, Javascript, Lua, and C++ (using a framework
#     like Boost or Qt.)
