The jxgl app can be made operational from the source by:

1. cd jsoncpp/src
   make
   cd ../..
2. cd jxgl
   qmake
   make
3. cd ..

Then the following should work:
 python sdf2json.py < drugs.sdf | jxgl/jxgl

Notes:
Only the first molblock from the input sdf file is processed.
No centering of the structure is done.  The display window
is fixed at 16 Angstom wide (-8 to +8) and the depth is -20 to 20 in z.
Some input sdf files may not be seen in this window.

See also the jxongl app in ./jxongl and it's INSTALL file.
