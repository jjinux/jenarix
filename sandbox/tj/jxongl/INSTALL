This app can be made operational from the source by:

qmake
make

Then the following should work:
 python ../sdf2json.py < ../drugs.sdf | ./jxongl
 ./jxongl < ../drugs.sdf

Notes:
Only the first molblock from the input sdf file is processed.
No centering of the structure is done.  The display window
is fixed at 16 Angstom wide (-8 to +8) and the depth is -20 to 20 in z.
Some input sdf files may not be seen in this window.
