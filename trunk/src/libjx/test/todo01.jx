# - bitwise operators

# - concurrency

#   - shared objects: immutable and indestructable

#   - synchronized objects: mutable, modifiable (atomically via
#     spinlock mutexes), indestructable

#   - what should the default copy behavior be for shared objects?
#     regardless of the default, the developer needs to be able to
#     force one before or the other:

#   - jx_ob_copy_with_shared(jx_ob) would preserved shared objects
#     within a hierarchy

#   - jx_ob_copy_to_unshared(jx_ob) would make a copy of the shared object

#   - for synchronized objects, the default jx_ob_copy behavior is
#     fine, but the should the copy be synchronized or not?  I say
#     not.
