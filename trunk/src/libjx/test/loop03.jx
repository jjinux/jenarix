# note: while expects a code block (a list of things to eval one after
# the other) as the second argument

(set i 3);
(while (decr i) [(output i)]);

# the shorthand below works because of exec's magic (dubious?) ability
# to recognize that [(output i)] is what was intended.

(set i 3);
(while (decr i) (output i));
