# What are the goals of the Jenarix Project?

# 1. To define the Jenarix Abtract Meta-Platform (JAMP), with a set of
#    requirements and features particularly well-suited for
#    development of highly-concurrent, network dataflow applications.

# 2. To develop two or more open-source Jenarix implementations, at
#    least one of which is efficient and practically useful (and
#    likely written in C).  The C implementation will be immediately
#    applied to refactoring of the PyMOL Molecular Viewer and will be
#    used in development of DeLano Scientific's future products.

#    Eventually we seek to have native Jenarix implementations written
#    in C, Python, Java, C++ (w/ a lib), JavaScript, Lua, COLA, CLR,
#    and pretty much any other interesting language platform.
