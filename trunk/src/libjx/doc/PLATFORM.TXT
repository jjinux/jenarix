# What defines the Jenarix Abstract Meta-Platform (JAMP)?

# I. The Jenaric Object (jx_ob / JxOb) capable of representing:

#  - Primitives: null, true, false, int, float, string, identifier

#  - Containers: list, hash

#  - Builtins: selectors, virtual machine functions, and native
#    functions of the underlying implementation platform.

# II. The JXON Virtual Machine (JXON VM)

#  NOTE: JXON is pronounced "Jackson" and is an abbreviation for
#  "Jenarix eXecutable Object Notation" as well as "JSON eXecutable
#  Object Notation".  

#  Think of JSON as data, and JXON as code with embedded JSON data.

#  - The JXON VM processes abstract syntax trees (ASTs) in much the
#    same way as a LISP or Scheme interpreter.  However, instead of
#    using lists of "cons" cells, the JXON VM uses JSON-like nested
#    data structures consisting of primitives, lists, and hashes.

#  - There is no JXON VM "bytecode".  JXON ASTs are executed directly,
#    and selectors present in the AST (with the help of a few
#    flow-control opcodes) drive the builtin aspects of the JXON VM.

#  - JXON is intended to serve as the intermediate language for the
#    Jenarix architecture and as a front end language for those who
#    rare developers who enjoy LISP or Scheme syntax.  Most users are
#    expected to create JXON code using one of the front-end dialects:
#    The Python dialect, the Shell dialect, or the Javascript dialect.

#  - The JXON VM is implemented using the features of the host
#    platform to the greatest practical extent.  For example, in the
#    PyJenarix implementation, the Jenaric list is simply a Python
#    list, whereas on C, which lacks a builtin list, the
#    implementation includes its own C structure for a list.

#  - The JXON VM can call native platform functions and vice versa,
#    and in a nested fashion.  Consequently, the JXON VM is stackful
#    to the extent that the host platform is stackful.  Each JXON VM
#    thread corresponds to a native host thread and will thus scale
#    well across multicore and many-core architectures (provided that
#    the host platform supports true concurrency).

#  - As a lowest-common-denominator virtual platform, JXON VM
#    deliberately avoids reliance upon of advanced modern language
#    features, such as coroutines, continuations, references, and
#    sophisticaed garbage collection.

#    Instead, the JXON VM embraces and implements the simple, highly
#    portable, and concurrency-friendly data & execution model of the
#    Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).  That means eliminating multiple
#    references to a single piece of data to the greatest extent
#    possible while still achieving reasonable program efficiency.
#    The primary benefits of adopting the DAG are (A) elimination of
#    references and thus the need for a garbage collector and (B)
#    suppport for lock-free concurrency where transfer of arbitrarily
#    complex data structures between threads is always a trivial,
#    lock-free O(1) operation.

#    Accordingly, the JXON VM is based largely on copy semantics.  An
#    assignment statement such as "X = Y" implies copying the DAG
#    represented by the symbol X into new storage associated with the
#    symbol Y.

#    Similarly, containers generally expect to assume ownership of
#    that which is placed inside them.  To actually move data from one
#    container to another without a copy, the user must "take" the
#    data out of the original container and then set it in the new
#    container, as shown here using actual JXON syntax:

(set X (take Y));

#  - Since references are almost effectively eliminated from the JXON
#    VM, JXON containers are normally only accessible by one thread at
#    a time and are safely mutable.  Containers which must be shared
#    between more than one thread are either marked read-only or
#    synchronized so as to provide atomicity with respect to changes.

#  - Each JXON thread has a single a toplevel hash representing its
#    exclusive namespace and which serves as the root node for the
#    DAG accessible to the thread.

#  - JXON VM functions are "functional" in that they take ownership of
#    and consume their argument object (an independent DAG) and return
#    their results as a new object (also a DAG) "owned" by the caller.

#  - JXON VM function closures are static in that they contain copies
     of the objects bound at the time of function definition.
     
III. The JXON Intermediate Language

#  - JXON is an extension of the JavaScript Serial Object Notation
#    (JSON) semantic (http://json.org) with the following semantic
#    changes:

#     - two new public primitive types have been added: 
#         identifier and opcode

#     - during runtime, additional builtin primitives exists
#       internally: selectors, JXON functions, native
#       functions, entity handles, and opaque (native platform)
#       objects.

#     - null, true, false, ints, floats, opcodes, and identifiers are
#       all allowed to be hash keys for JXON hashes

#     - during runtime, builtin primitives are also allowed to be hash
#       keys.

#  - JXON structure may be serially encoded in JSON directly (using
#    string escape prefixs for identifiers and non-string hash keys),
#    or they may be written and read using JXON ASCII notation which
#    is itself a direct extension of the JSON syntax with the
#    following syntatic changes:

#    - JXON identifiers match regexp pattern [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0.]+ and
#      are exclusive of null, true, and false.

#    - Commas are optional delimiters in JXON syntax -- whitespace is
#      sufficient to separate objects.

#    - JXON parsers accept either parentheses or square braces as
#      input, provided that they come in matched pairs.  This is done
#      to embrace LISP or Scheme syntax.

#    - The JXON parser supports #-delimited single-line comments,
#      which are ignored.

#    - When JXON objects are streamed syntactically, as found in JXON
#      source code, multiple JXON phrases may be optionally separated
#      by semicolons.  The benefit of using semicolons is that the
#      parser will catch unmatched parentheses or braces immediate
#      upon encountering a semicolon instead of have such typos
#      confounded with the next phrases.

# IV. Jenarix Networks: Concurrent Dataflow Programming Made Easy!

#  Jenarix networks exist to facilitate development of complex,
#  data-intensive, concurrent applications while avoiding the pitfalls
#  of multithreaded programming using explicit threads, locks,
#  mutexes, etc., without being subject to the performance limitations
#  of independent operating system processes or the complexity of
#  shared memory.

#  - Jenarix Networks consist of connected Nodes within a network-wide
#    namespace, where each Node may itself be a network with its own
#    Nodes residing in its own namespace.

#  - Each Node is a Jenarix network is a "actor" potentially capable
#    of running concurrently with respect to all nodes in all all
#    other networks.

#  - Jenarix Nodes may own a dedicated machine thread, a "green"
#    thread timesliced by the Jenarix scheduler, or they may simple
#    process objects in a purely functional way as they are fed.

#  - Jenarix Nodes can be stateful or stateless.  Stateless nodes
     run concurrently with themselves.

#  - Each Node has a namespace for ports, which include the default
#    ports: input, output, and error, with default wiring matching
#    the unix command line shell paradigm.

#  - Connected Nodes within a given Network can ship Jenaric objects
#    (DAGs) along their "pipe" without enlisting the help (and thus
#    blocking) their host Network.

#  - Disconnected Nodes can send Jenarix objects (DAGs) to other nodes
#    by name, using the namespace of the host network

#  - Jenarix Network can be defined using a simple declarative script
#    with networks described using shell-like "pipe" syntax.
