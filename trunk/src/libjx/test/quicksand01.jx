# Numbers used as hash keys are distinct based on type (int vs. float
# vs. boolean).  This is not the way Python works, but it is
# reflective of the underlying reality inside the computer, and
# personally I think it makes sense. (Python is even more bizarre in
# that 0, 0.0, and False are all equivalent hash keys!)

(set h {})
(set h 1 "int one")
(set h 1.0 "float one")

(get h 1)
# result: "int one"

(get h 1.0)
# result: "float one"
