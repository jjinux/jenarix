Add qtJxin function to process jxon graphics primitives
and display them in the opengl widget.  This would use code from the
sandbox/tj/jxongldock programs that parses and displays these files
in a fixed gui app.

Extend qtJxon to take a filename to output, and/or just return the
jxon string.

Add qtHide, qtShow, qtDelete, qtInsert, etc. functions to modify the
gui tree/list as defined in the input file.

Modify jxobject.cpp to use the ENV features of jxon.

Extend jxobject.cpp to include an Entity object.
